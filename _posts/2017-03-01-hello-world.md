I decided to participate in <a href="http://dajsiepoznac.pl/" target="_blank">GetNoticed</a>. Short story even shorter, it's about writing OpenSource code and blog about it (and IT).

I chose to make a port of old game - The Settlers II in Elixir. Being more specific I will focus only (or mainly) on backend. Why?
<ul>
 	<li>I've never made any "serious" app in Elixir/Erlang/F# any other functional language - this seems like a good opportunity</li>
 	<li>I feel like this is the good way of learning Elixir itself</li>
 	<li>Creating backend only will force me to solve some challenging design problems</li>
 	<li>UI will be easily changeable, so anyone can make their own version of game. Imagine The Settlers 2 in space, or Stone Age!</li>
 	<li>I feel like there's not enough "nice" code in the GameDev world. One project won't make a difference, but won't hurt as well</li>
 	<li>It's a scary challenge</li>
 	<li>I love this game</li>
</ul>
I will deep dive into details with next posts. Also, expect at least one commit per week! Here's <a href="https://github.com/Dreat/OpenSettlersII">repository </a>for the project on GitHub for you to follow.
