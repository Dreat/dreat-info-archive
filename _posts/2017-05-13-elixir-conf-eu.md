Hello!

There was a week without updates as I went to the Barcelona to attent Elixir Conf Eu - and afterwards made a short vacation. This time I won't be as specific as I was with ErlangFactoryLite; it was way bigger conference and I didn't get to see all talks as well. Truth be told - but it's a problem with any bigger conference - overall level of talks was lower than EFL's ones - but it's inevitable. Organisation was really good, as the venue.

I have some stuff to share, less now, more later when I deep dive into them.

First, there's something called <a href="https://github.com/parroty/excheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickCheck</a>. It's enables to do Property Testing - I'm not feeling comfortable enough with my knowledge of this subject to try explaning it, but I'm looking forward getting to know it more and write about it here!

Another thing is <a href="http://www.purescript.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PureScript </a>(looks like you can read a <a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript/read" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended book here</a> for free!). It's compiled to JavaScript (as all of those new front-end stuff), but apparently you can also compile to Erlang and some other as well! It's influenced by Haskell, more elastic and powerful than Elm (which is easy to learn, but apparently if your app doesn't fit Elm's architecture you will have a lot of pain). I never did anything serious in frontend from start to finish (I did some work with React + <a href="http://cerebraljs.com/docs/get_started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cerebral,</a> but I wouldn't call myself front-end specialist) so I guess this could be an interesting start.

Nerves strikes again, as this time distributed computing on Rasps was shown. It's nice to see that this project grows. And also: nice project to get started: make temperature controller for beer fermentation (old fridge, old lightbulb for hear and rasp pi running nerves)!
